# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This repository contains a simple implementation of Caesar cipher encryption and decryption in C++.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

This implementation provides functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher with a given shift value.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypts a given plaintext message using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift value.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts a Caesar cipher encrypted message back to its original plaintext using the same shift value.
